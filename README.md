# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## E-Commerce Back End

Build an e-commerce backend. Since there is no real front end this will be accessed and manipulated using insomnia.

## User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```
## How to use

1) Clone or copy repository to your computer
2) create a .env file with your credentials for the database
3) Run "npm i" in terminal
4) Run "mysql -u root -p" and then enter your password
5) Run "mysql source ./db/schema.sql"
6) Quit Mysql terminal and run "npm run seed" in terminal
7) Run "npm start" in terminal
8) Manipulate and modify in Insomnia



## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```
